A better JavaScript client for GDAX

This is a work in progress. Check back soon for a complete client.

If you have tried to use the official GDAX client for Node.js, you probably realized that it is broken/not maintained. This is an attempt to provide a full-featured, working client using modern JavaScript design principles.
